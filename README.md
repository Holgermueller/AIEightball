# Eat_a_burger
An exercise using handlebars, MySQL, express, and Mvc.

## How it works:

* Order a burger by typing its name into the field provided at the bottom of the screen and hit the ADD IT!! button.

* After your order is placed, your burger's name will appear in the list of tasty looking burgers.

* When your ready to eat, click the button marked "Eat It!!"

* Once your burger has been eaten, its name will appear in the list of burgers on the right side of the screen.

* [body_parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
